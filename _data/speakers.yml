Being a computer student I see the logics behind every ideas and therefore I decide whether to be involved in it or not. Most of all I like to discuss about the research topics and new ideas and innovations.
I have enlisted some ideas of establishing a Research Lab (lab where every ideas is researched and it gets an evolutionary format). Its my one only dream project without any members till the date. I have yet not transparently documented my project but after completing my BSc. i will work on it."
